# UK-Traffic-Analysis
This Big data project analysis is about proving the hypothesis : Age of the driver between 40 and 60 are more prone to accidents.

Data set obtained from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles#Accident_Information.csv

This dataset is from 2005 to 2017 with 2M rows. It contains two csv files:
a)Vehicle_Information.csv: A file containing information about the vehicles,  point of impact, maneuvers made, driver information, etc.
b)Accident_Information.csv: A file containing details about the accident that include location, junction details, date and time, accident severity, etc. 

Both files are joined by accident_index.

After the Exploratory analysis, unsupervised appraoch is used. Clustering comes into action for proving the hypothesis. The methods used are Kmeans and Kmodes.

There are few visualizations of the result as well.
